## How to Use These Scripts

### For Each Video:

1. **Read the script** - Understand the flow and steps
2. **Prepare test data** - Have test accounts and events ready
3. **Capture screenshots** - Follow the "Screenshots Needed" list at the end of each script
4. **Record screen** - Follow the steps while narrating (or add voiceover later)
5. **Edit** - Add annotations, transitions, and captions

### Tips for Recording:

- **Use a clean test account** - Don't show personal data
- **Use mobile view** - Most users are on mobile (this is a PWA)
- **Show the browser** - Include the address bar so users trust the URL
- **Pause on important UI** - Give viewers time to see buttons/fields
- **Highlight clicks** - Use cursor highlighting or zoom effects

### Screenshot Annotation Suggestions:

- **Red circles/arrows** - Draw attention to buttons to click
- **Numbered steps** - Show sequence (1, 2, 3)
- **Text labels** - Identify UI elements being discussed
- **Blur sensitive data** - Hide any personal information
